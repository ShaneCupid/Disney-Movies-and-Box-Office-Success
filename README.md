# Analysis of Box Office Success of Disney Movies

## Overview
This DataCamp project delves into the historical data of Disney movies to uncover patterns and factors that contribute to their box office success. Through data exploration and regression analysis, this project aims to provide insights into the profitability of Disney films.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3: For executing the project code.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Linear Regression: To understand relationships between the movie's features and their financial success.

## Description
The dataset, provided by Kelly Garrett, includes 579 Disney movies with details such as movie title, release date, genre, MPAA rating, total gross, and inflation-adjusted gross. The project includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions and trends.
- Building a linear regression model to explore the relationship between a movie's genre and its box office success.
- Bootstrapping technique to estimate model parameters' confidence intervals.

## How It Works
1. Data is loaded and preprocessed to convert dates and categorize genres.
2. Statistical summaries are provided for different genres and release years.
3. A linear regression model is built to predict box office success based on genre.
4. The analysis concludes with recommendations for movie production focus based on the model's findings.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Ensure you have Python 3 and the required packages installed.
* Clone the repository to get the Jupyter notebook and dataset.
* Run the notebook to replicate the analysis.

## Acknowledgements
This project is part of the coursework from DataCamp and is intended to demonstrate skills in data analysis and machine learning as applied to real-world datasets.
